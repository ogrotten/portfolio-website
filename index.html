                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>I am a graduate of the Full Stack Web track of Lambda School. Completed the 4 Units of primary and Computer Science instruction with high marks, completed Lambda Labs project with high marks.</p>
                    <p>Previously, I have owned team-developed websites for 10 years, and self-taught JavaScript and NodeJS. I was also an IT professional, primarily in support roles.</p>
                    <p>As a technologist, I have been drawn more to programming and development than support. I realized that I needed to grow and refine my dev skills and therefore attended Lambda School.</p>
                    <p>I am a family man with 5 kids, and enjoy the challenges and rewards that have come with that role.</p>
